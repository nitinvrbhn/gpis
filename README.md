<h1>GPIS: Unofficial git extension</h1>

## Why GPIS
GPIS provides additional features over GIT which is useful in organisation-level code management.

## Additional Features
Currently, I have implemented only the following feature.
### Sync the changes 
Here, GPIS, syncs your code with the server and other machine. It gives a team the ability to collaborate on the same branch with minimal conflicts.
To start the sync - Checkout the desired branch and hit `gpis start`.

## Installation
To install, 
- Copy the [`gpis`](https://github.com/nitinvrbhn/gpis/blob/main/gpis) file to your desired location.
- Add that location in your PATH variable
- That's it
